        <h2>Colosseum</h2>
        <img height="400" src="images/romePlaces.jpeg" alt="Colosseum">
        <p>The Colosseum is the main symbol of Rome. It is an imposing construction that, with almost 2,000 years of history, will bring you back in time to discover the way of life in the Roman Empire.</p>
        <p>The construction of the Colosseum began in the year 72 under the empire of Vespasian and was finished in the year 80 during the rule of the emperor Titus. After completion, the Colosseum became the greatest Roman amphitheatre, measuring 188 meters in length, 156 meters in width and 57 meters in height.</p>


        <h3>How To Visit</h3>
        <p>The Colosseum is very well serviced by Rome’s extensive public transport network. It can be reached by subway, multiple bus lines, and by tram. Below is a list of all public transport options to go to the Colosseum from practically anywhere in Rome.</p>

        <h2>Vatican City</h2>
        <img height="500" src="images/romePlaces1.jpeg" alt="vatican city">
        <p>The Vatican City State is an independent city-state located within Rome in Italy. The Vatican is governed by the Holy See, and is an ecclesiastical or sacerdotal-monarchical state ruled by the Pope.</p>
        <p>It is the smallest state in the world. It became independent from Italy with the Lateran Treaty. One of the most important sources of money for the Vatican's economy is tourism. The Vatican Museums and the St. Peter's Basilica are extremely popular tourist attractions. The Vatican Museums alone attracted 4.3 million people in 2007</p>

        <h3>How To Visit</h3>
        <p>Vatican City is just to the north of the city centre of Rome, Italy and is easily reached independently by public transport.

        Although Vatican City is a separate state to Italy and Rome there are no barriers or checks and Rome long ago has expanded all around the Vatican and far beyond. To the casual visitor Vatican City could be thought of as a district of Central Rome.
            
         For the first time visitor, the vast majority will be making for St Peter's Square or the Vatican Museums.</p>
        

        <h2>Spanish Steps</h2>
        <img height="400" src="images/romePlaces2.jpeg" alt="Spanish Steps">
        <p>The Spanish Steps are a set of steps dating from 1723, climbing a steep slope between the Piazza di Spagna at the base and Piazza Trinita dei Monti at the top dominated by Trinita dei Monti Church.</p>
        <p>The steps are at the eastern end of the old city centre. From the base there is a maze of very narrow lanes crammed full with designer shops waiting to be explored.</p>
        <p>The Spanish Steps are still a place for artists, painters and poets to visit. Today, at the top of the Spanish Steps you will find a cluster of artists painting visitor’s portraits.</p>

        <h3>How To Visit</h3>
        <p>By Metro take Linea A (red line) and exit at Spagna. The station is right next to the Spanish Steps.

            Rome city buses are too big to negotiate the narrow streets around the Spanish Steps, plenty of buses go to Barberini or Piazza del Popolo / Flaminio about a 10 minute walk away.
            
            There are a myriad of Rome hop on, hop off bus operators, all of which will not stop at the Spanish Steps itself as the buses are too large, but will stop within a 10-minute walk.
            
            A classic Rome walk is to start at the Spanish Steps and end at Piazza Navona visiting the Trevi Fountain and Pantheon on the way.</p>
