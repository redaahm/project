        <p>According to tradition, Venice was founded in 421 AD. At that time a Celtic people called the Veneti lived
            along the coast of what is now Northeast Italy. Since 49 BC they had been Roman citizens. However, in 453
            Attila the Hun invaded Italy. In terror, some Veneti fled to islands in the lagoon and built a village
            there. They soon formed a loose federation. Then in 568 AD, a people called the Lombards invaded the
            mainland and many Veneti fled to the islands swelling the population.</p>
        <p>Venice has been known as "La Dominante", "La Serenissima", "Queen of the Adriatic", "City of Water", "City of
            Masks", "City of Bridges", "The Floating City", and "City of Canals". The lagoon and a part of the city are
            listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Parts of Venice are renowned for the beauty of their settings, their
            architecture, and artwork.</p>

        <h2>The Origins of Venice</h2>
        <img id="hp1" height="400" width="700" src="images/veniceHistory1.jpg" alt="venice history">
        <p>Venice developed a creation myth that it was founded by people fleeing Troy, but it was probably formed in
            the sixth century C.E., when Italian refugees fleeing Lombard invaders camped on the islands in the Venice
            lagoon. There is evidence for a settlement in 600 C.E., and this grew, having its own bishopric by the end
            of the 7th century. The settlement soon had an outside ruler, an official appointed by the Byzantine Empire,
            which clung onto a part of Italy from a base in Ravenna. In 751, when the Lombards conquered Ravenna, the
            Byzantine dux became a Venetian Doge, appointed by the merchant families who had emerged in the town.</p>
        <p>Beginning as early as AD 166–168, the Quadi and Marcomanni destroyed the main Roman town in the area,
            present-day Oderzo. This part of Roman Italy was again overrun in the early 5th century by the Visigoths
            and, some 50 years later, by the Huns led by Attila. The last and most enduring immigration into the north
            of the Italian peninsula, that of the Lombards in 568, left the Eastern Roman Empire only a small strip of
            coastline in the current Veneto, including Venice.</p>

        <h2>How Was Venice Built?</h2>
        <img class="hp" height="400" src="images/veniceHistory2.jpeg" alt="Venice History img">
        <p>The construction of Venice started in the 5th century AD after the fall of the Roman Empire when refugees
            from the mainland fled to the islands in the lagoon. Soon, there were so many of them that they needed more
            space, so they drove wooden poles deep into the clay beneath the ground. On top of the wooden poles, they
            built wooden platforms, and then on top of that, they constructed their buildings—all of which means that
            Venice is basically built on wood and water. The wood has miraculously avoided decay over the centuries
            since it’s underwater and not exposed to oxygen, and also because the saltwater has hardened the wood into a
            more durable stone-like consistency. Still, today Venice is sadly sinking every year, mainly due to the
            steadily increasing sea levels.</p>
        <p>Venice was built by driving long pointed poles of wood; oak, larch, or pine, straight down into the seafloor.
            Two layers of horizontal planking were laid out. Over that, they put layers of stone that made up the
            foundation of the city. This technique is ancient, and the method existed even as long ago as in the days of
            the Roman empire. The Venetians just improved and developed it.</p>
