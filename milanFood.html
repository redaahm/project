                    <td>Langosteria offers perhaps the city’s best fish and 
                        crustaceans in an upscale dining environment. 
                        But don’t expect stuffy formality here: the charming 
                        sea-inspired decorations give Langosteria a warmth not 
                        often found in high-end seafood restaurants. Try the 
                        Catalan-style main courses, out of which the Catalan-style 
                        king crab gets top marks. If you prefer your seafood raw, 
                        take your pick from the impressive oyster collection or order 
                        one of the raw-fish platters featuring delicacies like red 
                        shrimp fished from the deep Mediterranean waters off Sicily.</td>

                    <td>This old fashioned trattoria in Porta Romana serves Calabrian 
                        dishes to a perennially packed dining room full of locals. 
                        The kitchen specialises in southern home cooking, like the restaurant’s
                        signature dish, spaghettoni alla tamarro, fresh pasta with tomato sauce and 
                        n’duja sausage, a spicy spreadable sausage paste made of pig shoulder 
                        and belly, as well as organ meat. If you’re vegetarian, order the parmigiana 
                        di melanzane, the Italian precursor to the popular Italian-American dish eggplant 
                        Parmesan – it’s a gooey reminder that the original is almost always better.</td>

                        of your brioche as you head for the office. At Pavé you come to linger on the 
                        velvety foam of one of the best cappuccinos in the city and to dreamily pause 
                        in front of the baked goods: cream brioches, chocolate dumplings, fruit tarts.
                        At Pave you can have a snack with bread, butter and marmalade and you enjoy an 
                        aperitif sipping Negroni and sinking your teeth in savory brioches and D.O.P. cheeses</td>
