            <h2>Milan Cathedral</h2>
                <img src="images/milanPlaces.jpg" width="450" height="400">
                <p>Milan’s Cathedral or Duomo di Milano as it is called in 
                    Italian, is the most famous monument in Milan and one of 
                    the most iconic landmarks in Italy. Milan cathedral is a 
                    wonderful examples of Gothic architecture and it is unique 
                    in Italy as strongly influenced by the aesthetic of Norther 
                    European Churches such as those in France and Germany.</p>
                <p>Construction of the current cathedral in Milan started in 1386 
                    and dragged on until 1965, although the church was of course 
                    already in use long before that — it was formally consecrated in 
                    1572. The magnificent facade was only completed in 1810 still 
                    several decades before a similar feat was accomplished in Florence. 
                    The high gothic exterior decorations include nearly 2300 statues, 
                    135 spires, nearly a hundred gargoyles, and endless architectural 
                    details. Many of the biblical scenes are fairly easy to read but many 
                    visitors are unfamiliar with events from the lives of various saints.</p>
                <h3>How to visit</h3>
                <P>Buying tickets online in advance is very much encouraged but a limited 
                    number of tickets are still sold onsite if time slots are available — card 
                    payments are preferred but cash is still possible. The ticket office is on 
                    the south side of the church (info point) or inside the Duomo Museum.</P>
                <p>All tickets are currently with time-slot reservations but queues still 
                    form at the security checkpoints and delays may occur at busy times, as the 
                    number of visitors allowed into the church at any given time is restricted.</P>

            <h2>Leonardo da Vinci’s Last supper</h2>
                <img src="images/milanPlaces1.jpg" width="450" height="400">
                <p>It is advisable to book a visit in advance or to book a tour a few days ahead. It 
                    is also worth researching tour options, as some include thirty minute private 
                    viewings of the mural, audio tours and queue jumping. It pays to plan ahead</p>
                <p>Leonardo da Vinci challenged the status quo with this great work when instead of 
                    adhering to the more common art of fresco painting, he used the plaster wall of 
                    a monk's refectory as his canvas. In The Last Supper, Leonardo da Vinci depicts 
                    the last moments Christ spent with his disciples before one of them would ultimately 
                    betray him. The disciples are arranged on either side of the dinner table, 
                    whilst Christ is situated in the middle. Years of painstaking work has gone 
                    into restoring </p>
                <h2>How to visit</h2>
                <p>From Milano Central FS, take the Metro, five stops, to Cadorna. From Cadorna, 
                    Santa Maria delle Grazie is a mere ten minute walk away. Exit the train station 
                    onto Via Carducci, walk for five minutes before turning right onto Corso Magenta. 
                    Walk for another five minutes and you will arrive at Santa Maria delle Grazie. </p>

            <h2>Quadrilatero d'Oro: Fashion district</h2>
            <img src="images/milanPlaces2.jpeg" width="450" height="400">
                    <p>For those who love fashion, it is a guide to your wildest dreams. Find the 
                        Quadrilatero d'Oro, the Golden Rectangle, which is lined with famous haute 
                        couture boutiques including Versace, Prada, and Armani. Vintage stores like 
                        Mercantino Michela, Superfly and Lipstick Vintage all offer designer labels like 
                        Ferragamo, Versace and Dolce & Gabbana for up to 75% less than the retail price. 
                        Bargains can also be found at outlets like D Magazine, Corso Como, and Il Salvagente.</p>
                    <p>Having opened in 1867, Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II's glass vaulted shopping arcade 
                        is one of the oldest shopping centres in the world. Its range of couture outposts, 
                        including Gucci and Louis Vuitton give it enduring appeal. It also happens to host 
                        Prada's flagship store. Via Torino, and Via Tortona are laced with curious little 
                        shops and designer showrooms whilst the Navigli area is the place to experience Milanese 
                        street-style at its best. A walking tour of the fashion district is a great way to get an 
                        overview and even some insider tips.</p>
                    <h3>How to visit</h3>
                    <p>From Milano Central Railway Station take line 3 towards San Donato. Exit at Turati and 
                        you will find yourself right in the middle of the fashion district. </p>
