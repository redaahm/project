    <h2>St. Mark's Basilica</h2>
    <img height="400" src="images/venicePlaces.jpeg" alt="St. Mark's Basilica">
    <p>Certainly Venice's best-known church, and one of the most easily recognized in the world, St. Mark's Basilica (Basilica di San Marco) was originally the Doge's private chapel, decorated with Byzantine art treasures that are part of the booty brought back by Venetian ships after the fall of Constantinople.</p>
    <p>The gold-backed mosaic pictures above the doorways on the façade only hint at the mosaic artistry inside, where 4,240 square meters of gold mosaics cover the domes and walls. These set a distinctly Byzantine tone to its soaring interior, but you'll find treasures from other periods, including later mosaics designed by Titian and Tintoretto - names you'll encounter all over the city.</p>
    <p>The magnificent golden altarpiece, the <b>Pala d'Oro</b>, one of the finest in Europe, was begun by early 12th-century artists, and centuries later, adorned with nearly 2,000 gems and precious stones. If you can tear your eyes from this, the mosaic domes, and the multitude of richly decorated altars, glance down at the floor, a masterpiece of marble inlay. And take time to see the gold reliquaries and icons in the <b>Treasury.</b></p>

    <h3>How To Visit</h3>
    <p>The entrance to St. Mark’s Basilica is free, but the entrance line is usually very long, so it is advisable to book a guided tour of the Basilica to avoid unnecessary waiting in line.</p>
    <p>St. Mark’s Basilica is located right in St. Mark’s Square or Piazza San Marco. It is probably one of the most iconic piazzas in the world. St. Mark’s Basilica is very central, so follow the signs for San Marco and you’ll easily find it.</p>
    <p>Most likely you will be arriving from the direction of the train station, which means you’ll first cross the square and then just look to your left. It’s impossible to miss.</p>

    <h2>Palazzo Ducale (Doge's Palace) and Bridge of Sighs</h2>
    <img height="400" src="images/venicePlaces1.jpeg" alt="Bridge of Sighs">
    <p>Visitors arriving in Venice once stepped ashore under the façade of this extraordinary palace. They couldn't have failed to be impressed, both by its size and the finesse of its architecture.</p>
    <p>If they were received inside by the Doges, the impression would only strengthen as they entered through the Porta della Carta, a perfect example of Venetian Gothic at its height, and ascended the monumental Scala dei Giganti and the gold-vaulted Scala d'Oro to be received in what many consider to be the palace's most beautiful chamber, Sala del Collegio.</p>
    <p>Even jaded 21st-century travelers gasp in awe at the palace's grandeur and lavish decoration. You'll see works by all the Venetian greats, including Tintoretto, whose Paradise is the largest oil painting in the world.</p>

    <h3>How To Visit</h3>
    <p>The Doge's Palace is located on the famous St. Mark's Square and right next to St. Mark's Basilica. Since most of Venice's must-see attractions are also located here, you don't need to make any special effort to get to Doge's Palace - it's the main area of the city that everybody visits.</p>
    <p>The entrance to the Palace is located on the wide waterfront promenade Riva degli
        Schiavone. Nowadays, you enter the Palace through the Grain Gateway (Porta del Frumento). A
        You can reach Doge's Palace on foot or by boat. If you are visiting Venice by car or by train and are walking from the Piazzale Roma area, simply follow the signs for 'San Marco'.
        Count about 30-45 minutes of walking time without any stops.</p>

        <h2>Canale Grande</h2>
        <img height="350" src="images/venicePlaces2.jpeg" alt="Canale Grande">
        <p>Sweeping through the heart of Venice in a giant reverse S curve, the Grand Canal is the principal boulevard through the city, connecting <b>Piazza San Marco, Rialto Bridge,</b> and the arrival points of the rail station and bridge from the mainland.</p>
        <p>Only four bridges cross its 3.8-kilometer length, but stripped-down gondolas called traghetti shuttle back and forth at several points between bridges. The Grand Canal was the address of choice for anyone who claimed any influence in Venice. Palaces of all the leading families open onto the canal, their showy Venetian Gothic and Early Renaissance facades facing the water, by which visitors arrived. These grand palaces – or at least their facades – are well preserved today, and a trip along the canal by vaporetto, Venice's floating public transport system, is the best way to see them.</p>

        <h3>How To Visit</h3>
        <p>Although there are water taxi services and tours most visitors experience of the Grand Canal will be from the water bus service. The workhorse route is route number 1 that stops at every stop along the Grand Canal. These are the largest boats, (see image) and even in Winter there are five boats an hour most of the day.</p>
